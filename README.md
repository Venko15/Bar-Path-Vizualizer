# Bar-Path-Vizualizer
My project for the subject VMKS - bar path vizualizer. Its goal is to track the movement path of a barbell/dumbell and then display it with additional info. To achieve it esp32 and arduino nano are used to track both ends of the object. The vizualization is going to be done within a website
